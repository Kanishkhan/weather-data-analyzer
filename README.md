ðŸ“Š Climate Data Analytics Dashboard
Developed a comprehensive data visualization dashboard using Python's Matplotlib and NumPy libraries to analyze climate patterns from 2000 to 2024. The dashboard includes:

Temperature Trends: Line graph showing yearly temperature fluctuations with markers for clarity.

Rainfall Distribution: Bar chart representing annual rainfall in millimeters to observe variability and trends.

Humidity-Temperature Correlation: Scatter plot analyzing the relationship between temperature and humidity percentages.

Temperature Prediction: Regression plot predicting future temperature trends using linear approximation.

Features clean layout, interactive legends, and effective data storytelling for quick insights into climate change indicators. Ideal for environmental research, academic reporting, and data science portfolios.
